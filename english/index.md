# Programming Passion Project
### English Project by {{ page.author }}

## (1) Mission Statement
The goal of this project extends beyond just completing an English 11 assignment.
Through this page, I hope to inform people about my experiences as a young developer,
as well as inform them of why software development is so important in the modern world.
All software needs to start with a person and a goal to solve some problem.
These problems, through software, are being solved such that many people don't even realize that there had ever been a problem.
Knowing how software works and learning to recognize design patterns as a developer or an end-user can be very helpful.
For a developer, recognizing design patterns is important because it allows you to learn and gain knowledge from others in the industry.
For an end-user, seeing how software is designed and potentially looking into why it's like that can help you potentially troubleshoot issues on your own,
or it can help you submit bug reports to help developers find problems with their software (assuming they accept bug reports).
Overall, software has impacted everyone, and it's important to realize that other people are behind the software.
Someone had to have made the `vi` text editor that has now become the basis of many modern text editors (such as my personal favorite, NeoVim), right?
Right, and that's one of the goals here, is to teach people the fact that software is made by people, and to show you what some of those people experience.
