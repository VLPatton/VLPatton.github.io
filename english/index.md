# Programming Passion Project

### English Project by {{ page.author }}

## (1) Mission Statement

The goal of this project extends beyond just completing an English 11 assignment.
Through this page, I hope to inform people about my experiences as a young developer,
as well as inform them of why software development is so important in the modern world.
All software needs to start with a person and a goal to solve some problem.
These problems, through software, are being solved such that many people don't even realize that there had ever been a problem.
Knowing how software works and learning to recognize design patterns as a developer or an end-user can be very helpful.
For a developer, recognizing design patterns is important because it allows you to learn and gain knowledge from others in the industry.
For an end-user, seeing how software is designed and potentially looking into why it's like that can help you potentially troubleshoot issues on your own,
or it can help you submit bug reports to help developers find problems with their software (assuming they accept bug reports).
Overall, software has impacted everyone, and it's important to realize that other people are behind the software.
Someone had to have made the `vi` text editor that has now become the basis of many modern text editors (such as my personal favorite, NeoVim), right?
Right, and that's one of the goals here, is to teach people the fact that software is made by people, and to show you what some of those people experience.

## (4.1) What is programming and why do I enjoy it?

Programming can be simply defined as the process by which a person or group of people develops software.
I enjoy it because it allows me to think critically about how I wanna solve a problem that I have.
I chose to present about this because I think it's important that people understand what software is, how it works, and why we use it to begin with.

## (4.2) How did I get started?

I got started with electrical design when I was about 11 or 12 years old.
From there, I moved onto programming for some of the circuits I had involving Arduino boards.
After doing a little bit of tinkering, I started to want to do more programming.
I have now been working on various personal projects (none of which have reached a "completion" state, ready for release). 

## (4.3.1) How can others benefit? Why should they care?

Other people can benefit from this passion because, through understanding what it is, you can create more helpful feedback for developers,
and this will help make the software you enjoy better.
For example, most phones in the world run Android, which is based on a Free Software suite, namely including the Linux kernel.
There's also the Android Open Source project, which aims to create a free (as in freedom) operating system for mobile ARM-based devices.
For an Open Source project, you can submit changes to the source code that may fix a bug or provide some sort of UX or UI improvement.
Everyone should care about software development because it affects all of us.
Everyone uses software; from your cellphone to your desktop PC to your laptop to the servers you connect to over the internet.
All of these devices have software that was created by someone.
Even the poor user freedom of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) had to be programmed by someone.

## (4.3.2) What's the impact of it? How was it challenging?

The impact of software has been global; like mentioned previously, software is used by everyone in the modern world.
Even in places you might not expect, software is likely involved somehow.
The main reason for this is the flexibility that software programming offers compared to a fixed-purpose design.
Software has helped us to create a world in which we don't have to think about everything we do or use.
For example, most people likely don't actually think too much about how the ARM CPU in their cellphone is able to talk with other devices.
Of course, it's done through software and standardization.
The software used to connect to the internet starts in the C Standard Library, which is a set of standardized APIs for communicating with the hardware on the device.
From there, you can write your apps using the `libc` (as it's most often referred to) in order to create an app that acts as a service,
and using this service - through Inter-Process Communication (IPC) calls or through a wrapper library to abstract the underlying `libc` code -
you have created an app or library that can be used to send and/or receive data over the wireless interfaces of your cellphone.
Of course, this is just scratching the surface; a user program or library doesn't have to worry about device handling directly,
as this is done by something like the Linux kernel.

## (2) Evidence of learning

I interviewed a freelancing programmer who is about my age, who will remain anonymous for this article.
This programmer had a couple things to say about their experiences getting into development and they will be available upon request.

I think it would also be appropriate to mention some people that I follow publicly in the realm of programming.
Some of these people are considered more "memey" than may always be expected, but I enjoy their content and I learn quite a bit from them;
I get a lot of my news in regards to current programming topics from them.
The list below contains hyperlinks to their platforms:

* [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)
* [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen)
* [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning)
* [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater)

I think the single most important website to use for learning about programming is probably YouTube,
just because there's so much content covering a wide variety of topics within programming.
However, if I had to designate a website for actually doing programming and helping you, it would be both Github and StackOverflow
(although, I wouldn't ever post to StackOverflow, as it has a notoriously toxic community).
