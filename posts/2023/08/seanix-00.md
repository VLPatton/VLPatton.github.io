# Seanix - what is it?
Seanix is a hobby kernel that I'm attempting to write. As of writing, it only features a very basic and limited physical memory allocator. I'm working on adding better memory map support for it at the time of writing.

I'm hoping to eventually get some amount of usability out of it for *something*, although who knows what it'll become if I actually stick with it. A lot of it's code will likely take after Zeanix, a similar project that I didn't ever actually stick with because it was organized poorly and only supported i686.

# Why?
I dunno, maybe it'll be fun, and it's certainly a great way to learn about all sorts of lower level topics.

I honestly think it's generally a good idea to learn how stuff works if you use it often, especially if using it is part of your job as a programmer. This is part of the reason I love systems development, but another reason is because it's fun, and I enjoy it. Is it frustrating? Oh you have no idea, but it still is enjoyable for me, at least to some extent.

# Can I help at all?
Yes, but I can't look through every PR in the world, mainly because I haven't setup some global contribution guidelines and style guides for the stuff I use (C, C++, Rust, Lua, etc.), and I really need to. However, don't let this stop you from forking and/or PR'ing the code. It's amazing to see other people interested in this stuff.
