# What is this?
A programming blog for me :)

# Why?
Because I got bored.

# Who even are you?
VLPatton, aka {{ page.author }}, and I do programming, mainly with systems languages, tho I've also done stuff with SvelteKit (coming soon).

# Okay, so what do you do?
I do systems programming as a hobby usually, but I am also intending to start professional work soon. I do my programming within NeoVim, with a config that may or may not be up to date in my [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/VLPatton/dotfiles) repo.
